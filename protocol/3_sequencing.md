# RegSeq Sequencing

## qPCR to Check DNA Contamination
qPCR was preformed to check the level of DNA contamination and the mRNA tags
were PCR amplified and Illumina sequenced. Within a single growth condition, all promoter
variants for all regulatory regions were tested in a single multiplexed RNA-Seq experiment. 




All sequencing was carried out by either the Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genomics
Laboratory at Caltech (HiSeq 2500) on a 100 bp single read flow cell or using the sequencing
services from NGX Bio on a 250 bp or 150 base paired end flow cell. The total library was
first sequenced by PCR amplifying the region containing the variant promoters as well as the
corresponding barcodes. This allowed us to uniquely associate each random 20 bp barcode with
a promoter variant. 

For all the MPRA experiments, only the region containing the random 20 bp barcode was
sequenced, since the barcode can be matched to a specific promoter variant using the initial library
sequencing run described above. For a given growth condition, each promoter yielded 50,000
to 500,000 usable sequencing reads. Under some growth conditions, genes were not analyzed
further if they did not have at least 50,000 reads.
