## Second Amplification and Barcoding of Oligo Library
The barcode was inserted 110 base pairs from the 5â€™ end of the mRNA, containing 45 base pairs from the targeted regulatory region, 64 base pairs containing primer sites used in the construction of the plasmid, and 11 base pairs containing a three frame stop codon. All the sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Following the barcode there is an RBS and a GFP coding region.

## Insertion of Barcoded Library into Plasmid Backbone
Mutated promoters were PCR amplified and inserted by Gibson assembly into the plasmid backbone of pJK14 (SC101 origin).

## Cloning or Integration of Barcoded Library
Constructs were electroporated into E. coli K-12 MG1655 [54].

## Pooling of _E. coli_ and DNA / RNA Isolation
Cells were grown to an optical density of 0.3 and RNA was then stabilized using Qiagen RNA Protect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Lysis was performed using lysozyme (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) and RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA Mini Kit. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript IV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and a specific primer for the labeled mRNA. 

The growth conditions studied in this study were inspired by [1] and include differing carbon sources such as growth in M9 with 0.5% Glucose, M9 with acetate (0.5%), M9 with arabinose (0.5%), M9 with Xylose (0.5%) and arabinose (0.5%), M9 with succinate (0.5%), M9 with fumarate (0.5%), M9 with Trehalose (0.5%), and LB. In each case cell harvesting was done at an OD of 0.3. These growth conditions were chosen so as to span a wide range of growth rates, as well as to illuminate any carbon source specific regulators. We also used several stress conditions such as heat shock, where cells were grown in M9 and were subjected to a heat shock of 42 degrees for 5 minutes before harvesting RNA. We grew in low oxygen conditions. Cells were grown in LB in a container with minimal oxygen, although some will be present as no anaerobic chamber was used. This level of oxygen stress was still sufficient to activate FNR binding, and so activated the anaerobic metabolism. We also grew cells in M9 with Glucose and 5mM sodium salycilate. Growth with zinc was preformed at a concentration of 5mM ZnCl2 and growth with iron was performed by first growing cells to an OD of 0.3 and then adding FeCL2 to a concentration of 5mM and harvesting RNA after 10 minutes. Growth without cAMP was accomplished by the use of the JK10 strain which does not maintain its cAMP levels.
