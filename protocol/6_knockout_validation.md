# RegSeq Knockout Validation

## Ordering from Keio Collection



Conducting DNA affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry on putative binding
sites resulted in potential candidates for the transcription factors that are responsible for the information contained at a given promoter region. For some cases, to verify that a given transcription
factor is, in fact, regulating a given promoter, we repeated the RNA sequencing experiments on
strains with the transcription factor of interest knocked out.
To construct the knockout strains, we ordered strains from the Keio collection [58] from the
Coli Genetic Stock Center. These knockouts were put in a MG1655 background via phage P1
transduction and verified with Sanger sequencing. To remove the kanamycin resistance that
comes with the strains from the Keio collection, we transformed in the pCP20 plasmid, induced
FLP recombinase, and then selected for colonies that no longer grew on either kanamycin or
ampicillin. Finally, we transformed our desired promoter libraries into the constructed knockout
strains, allowing us to perform the RNA sequencing in the same context as the original experiments.
