# Sequence processing scripts

In this folder you can find bash scripts that perform the processing of sequence data and put it in the format needed to perform MCMC step to infer information footprints.
To perform quality filtering on sequence files, we use [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp). Follow the installation instructions and create a conda environment called `fastp`.
