    "When generating mutated sequences for a Reg-Seq experiment, we typically \"cluster\" 3-5 mutated gene libraries together. Each of these clusters shares a set of orthogonal primer binding sites, enabling each cluster to be individually amplified, apart from the other mutated libraries. In this context orthogonal means that the generated primers do not cross-hybridize, i.e., the probability of binding of primers to each other is very low. The number of possible 20mers is about $10^12$, therefore the probability of generating a primer that is identical to a 20mer in the genome is negligible. We cluster genes in this way for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If one pair of orthogonal primers does not amplify as well as the other primer pairs, one needs not throw out the entire oligo pool; rather, you could simply reorder the 3-5 affected genes, thus potentially saving money in the future.\n",
    "2. Clustering genes enables selective amplification of a subset of genes. If you wanted to repeat Reg-Seq on just a handful of related genes, for instance, then you could specifically amplify that subset and repeat the experiment. Again, this would save money, as you would not waste sequencing reads on an Illumina machine by repeating a Reg-Seq experiment on the entire oligo pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many orthogonal primer pairs (3,000, to be exact) that can be appended to groups of sequences for selective amplification. We use orthogonal primer pairs that were developed by the Kosuri lab at UCLA, a full list of which can be found in the the data/primers folder of this GitHub repository."

In this example we compute the number of sequences per gene with the variable `nseqs`, which is 150000/8 - 1 = 18749.
