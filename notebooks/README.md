# Jupyter Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks following the [RegSeq experiment protocol](https://github.com/RPGroup-PBoC/RegSeq/wiki). The numbering refers to the step in the protocol where the notebook is used. All code used in the notebooks is included in the `regseq` module, and by following the instructions on the [`Home` page](https://github.com/RPGroup-PBoC/RegSeq/wiki/home), a compatible Python environment can be installed.
