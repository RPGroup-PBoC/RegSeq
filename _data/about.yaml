Abstract: >
  Advances in DNA sequencing have revolutionized our ability to read genomes.
  However, even in the most well-studied of organisms, the bacterium *Escherichia
  coli*, for ~65% of the promoters we remain completely ignorant of their regulation.
  Until we have cracked this regulatory Rosetta Stone, efforts to read and write
  genomes will remain haphazard. We introduce a new method (Reg-Seq) linking a
  massively-parallel reporter assay and mass spectrometry to produce a base pair
  resolution dissection of more than 100 promoters in *E. coli* in 12 different
  growth conditions. First, we show that our method recapitulates regulatory
  information from known sequences. Then, we examine the regulatory architectures
  for more than 80 promoters in the *E. coli* genome which previously had no known
  regulation. In many cases, we also identify which transcription factors mediate
  their regulation. The method introduced here clears a path for fully characterizing
  the regulatory genome of model organisms, with the potential of moving on to an
  array of other microbes of ecological and medical relevance.
