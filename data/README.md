# Data

In this folder all data, if generated by experiments or analysis, will be stored. Large files should not be stored in the repo, but only locally. 

## barcode_keys
In this folder the keys which map a barcode to a sequence are stored. Files produced by the `regseq.create_key` module, and have the labeling standard `genename_barcode_key.csv`. So if the same gene is part of multiple experiments, it should be ensured that the files are not overwritten.

## inference_results
Folder to store results of all possible inference methods used.

## massspec
Folder that contains data generated by Mass Spectrometry experiments.

## neg_control_seqs_GU

## primers
Folder that contains orthogonal primer sequences.

## prior_designs
Folder that contains all files that are generated prior to the experiment. That includes information about the genes of interest, their transcription start site, and direction of transcription. Also this folder contains generated mutated sequences bases on wild type genomes.

## sequencing data
Folder that contains all data acquired from sequencing.

## wild_type
Folder that contains wild_type genomes.
