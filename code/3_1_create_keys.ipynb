    "In this notebook we perform the mapping step on the quality score filtered sequences. Therefore we need to find the barcode and the sequences we generated in previous steps, and filter for unique barcode and sequence mappings. First, we check the length of sequences and discard sequences whose length is varying from the consensus, since this is likely caused by insertions or deletions. Also we are discarding sequences with unresolved base pairs, i.e., a `N` in the sequence. <br><br>\n",
    "We are taking into consideration that there might be sequencing errors that lead to ambiguous mappings, therefore if a barcode maps to multiple sequences which are very similar, the most counted sequence is taken as consensus sequence. Finally, we compare sequences to the wild type genome, to identify which gene the sequence belongs to. \n",
